                        <p>I'm deluded.
            <br>
                        If I tell a lie enough I'll start to believe it myself
            <br>
                        Then I can't tell the difference from the truth
            <br>
                        And I get stuck in between because I'm unable to pull myself from a deluded dream.
        
            <br>
            <br>

                        I'm crazy
            <br>
                        I lose it sometimes 
            <br>
                        Like all the times but I've learned not to mind
            <br>
                        Because it sucks but it's also a plus that crazy is apart of thine 

            <br>
            <br>

                        I'm unrealistic
            <br>
                        I try to see things your ways
            <br>
                        But that's impossible because what's impossible to you is a possibility for me
            <br>
                        It's my way or nothing because more times than never your way is just too depressing

            <br>
            <br>

                        I'm a dreamer
            <br>
                        I dream too much
            <br>
                        I see everything as a trial for when my real life begins
            <br>
                        But when will it begin.
            <br>
                        It seems I've been waiting too long for something wildly expected to come   along

            <br>
            <br>
                    
                        I'm lazy
            <br>
                        So much talent in one place 
            <br>
                        I'll be the one to let myself fall
            <br>
                        I won't survive if I dont learn to stop hiding my call.
            <br>
                        But it's stressful knowing what I possess and if I don't get to truly release it.
            <br>
                        Then I'll surely end up dead.
            <br>
                        If then, I hope it’s not because I tried to kill myself again.
                    
            <br>
            <br>

                        I'm depressed
            <br>
                        My worse fear is suicide, my worse enemy is my mind, and I don't know how long I can hide.
            <br>
                        Everyone thinks it's okay, that I’m fine but they still remind me that I tried 
            <br>
                        I still see it in their eyes
            <br>
                        And at that moment sometimes the suppression accidentally subsides and I find myself reliving the most painful experience to exist in and I cry because I'm scared of the enemy inside because I've heard that sometimes your demons strive.

            <br>
            <br>

                        Help me 
            <br>
                        My thoughts set me up for my faults to swallow me
            <br>
                        I have many more but I can't decipher if I'm something more to be or just  some deluded crazy unrealistic dreamer that hangs on to lost dreams because I'm too lazy or depressed to help me first this time in the scare of being too selfish for wanting more from my life.
            <br>
                        I don't want to be like that so my only way out is to write and follow my own reality
            <br>
                        It's in my head now but tomorrow soon enough it'll be someone else's dream and my true beginning into a world that's been long awaiting me will be real.
            <br>
                        And I will hopefully be able to live in my truth and exist as surreal.
            <br>
                        For I know that I am sick, It's something I can feel
            <br>
                        And though I hat to admit, It's all too real.
            <br>
                        Like a fallen tree in the rainforest that no one has seen,
            <br>
                        Can it then remain that make my illness any less real.</p>
