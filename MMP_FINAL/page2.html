                        <p> Hi everyone, welcome to another episode of Lioness, Live Life Fierce. Today’s podcast will be  a true story narrative of girl who has struggled with depression all her life. To keep it anonymous we named her Dana.                    
                    
            <br>
            <br>           

                        <p> Dana has been experiencing suicidal tendencies since she was 12 years of age. She never knew what was wrong with her and neither did the adults in her life. She had a tendency to be okay 1 minute but have an anger outburst at someone for the smallest things. People thought she was impulsive and a problem but she was never white labeled ad a trouble maker.

                        She would get so sad that she would attempt to drink bleach or she would go into the kitchen hold a knife to her stomach. Yet she didn’t think much about it. As the years went by she started to become more and more fatigued, losing interest in her favorite things. She would stay up all night losing sleep, and she was developing a feeling of worthlessness and low self-esteem and she over compensating for her feelings by over eating which caused her to gain weight. 
                        
            <br>            
            <br>            

                        All these things for years went unnoticed by everyone around her. At age 15 she stared to cut. She knew something was wrong with her but she was afraid of getting help because she didn’t want to deal with the stigma. It wasn’t until she was 18, during an depressive episode that 1 of her aunts discovered a poetry book she had filled poems she wrote about what she was going through. From there her cuts were discovered.

             <br>           

                        At first they raised alarms in the family but Caribbean’s they never followed up. They made her promise to stop cutting and she did but she was still hurt. So she would hot the curling iron and burn herself. Her suicidal tendencies were developing. She was now experiencing major depressive episode that would last days at a time, and most recently weeks. She would be on the train on the way to school and wouldn’t be able to get off due to her have suicidal ideations of jumping front of the train.

                        She was completely afraid of her mind and she still is. 1 minute she would be fine and the next she would be clinging to the phone ringing the suicide hotline or her Therapist for dear life. She knew she was in danger. There was a threat to her life and it was her. She was afraid and no one in her life knew. Coming from a Caribbean household seeking help for mental health is unheard of. It’s just not done. Caribbean’s prefer to suffer in silence, as many do, as she did for a very long time but she decided to get help. One day she went to the councilor’s office at her school and talked. After a while of weekly counseling the councilor was finally able to convince her to go to the hospital and get real therapy. After a major death in her family pushing her to a near death herself, she finally decided to put aside her embarrassment and seek help.

                        She is currently in therapy taking it a day at a time. But there is rarely a moment went she doesn’t think about dying. It’s hard to count how many times her therapist has tried to get her to get admitted to the hospital for further help because she doesn’t want to explain to her family why.

                        It’s a funny thing playing both antagonist and protagonist in your own story. This is what it’s like for many people today. Dana’s fear of judgment caused her deny herself treatment for a disease that was trying to kill her. An even when she isn’t experiencing a major episode she still finds it hard sometimes just to get out of bed and face the day. It is a constant struggle for her to try and live a somewhat normal life with such a huge secret.

                        The burden of which also weighs heavily on her heart. It is a lot to deal with and I told that story today get people to be more understanding towards depression. Always remember, people die from this disease. Every day is another of fight yourself for the right to live.  </p>
