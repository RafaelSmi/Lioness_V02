                        <p> As you may or may not know the month of May is Mental Illness Awareness month and so it just seemed fit it have this discussion today. Specifically depression, now what is depression? According to the American Psychiatric Association depression is described as:
                        
            <br>
            <br>

                        “Depression (major depressive disorder) is a common and serious medical illness that negatively affects how you feel, the way you think and how you act. Fortunately, it is also treatable. Depression causes feelings of sadness and/or a loss of interest in activities once enjoyed. It can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems and can decrease a person’s ability to function at work and at home.”
                        
            <br>               
            <br>               

                        Now the key words in this definition are ‘serious medical illness’. Serious. I feel like this needs to be emphasized because most people take the idea of a mental illness lightly. Just because the effects are not immediately visible doesn’t mean that they don’t exist. There are stigmas out there like this that makes it hard for most people to seek help or even accept help. Mental Illness is real, Depression is real.

           <br>             

                        There are many different types and levels of depression. The 1 I will be talking about today is 
                            
                        Persistent Depressive Disorder with Suicidal tendencies (PDD). It is also known as Dysthymia. This a chronic form of depression that is more than just about feeling sad it causes many people to not only think about death and suicide but they also tend to practice self-mutilation.</p>
